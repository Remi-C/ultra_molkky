  "body": "# Ultra Molkky\r\n## The Project\r\n The Ultra Molkky is a re-design of the classical Molkky game so the game-play is harder,\r\nand the game elements more stylish.\r\n\r\nIt was designed as a weeding gift for a French-Finnish couple.\r\n\r\n![the finished molkky game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky/master/illustrations/finished_game/box_oppenned.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n - [Hélène Marian](http://www.helenemarian.com/)\r\n - Félix Salasca\r\n - Louis Coulais\r\n - Rémi Cura\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n### Concept\r\nThe concept is to make a harder and more stylish Molkky.\r\n\r\n![re-designed wooden pins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky/master/illustrations/pins/quilles_brutes.JPG)\r\n - To make the game harder :\r\n   * we re-design the wooden pins to be more stable, so they better resist dropping :\r\n     - wooden pins are made from heavier wood (black locust)\r\n     - wooden pins base form is more stable \r\n     - wooden pins are angled inward to lower the centre of masse\r\n   * wooden pins are slightly less wide to be harder to hit\r\n   * the molkky pin is also less wide\r\n\r\n![esthetic redesign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky/master/illustrations/lettering/lettering_logo.jpg)\r\n - To make the game more stylish \r\n  * We use nicer woods that is naturally durable (black locust,boxwood and teak)\r\n  * the molkky pin has a more complex form\r\n  * we change the form of wooden pins so they follow the initial position of molkky wooden pins\r\n  * the box form is the same as the pins\r\n  * Pins number is carved and paint\r\n  * we use Sign painting methods to decorate the box\r\n  * we incorporate heavy leather\r\n  * the box joinery work is sophisticated\r\n\r\n### Furnitures\r\n - wooden pins:\r\n  * black locust, sign painting (red)\r\n - box :\r\n  * black locust, teak for the inlay, brass nails, veg tanned superior leather, linen waxed thread, exterior wood glue\r\n - molkky pin (also serves as box handle): box wood\r\n\r\n### Building step\r\n\r\n![Hand carved ans paint wooden pins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky/master/illustrations/pins/quilles_dans_boite.jpg)\r\n\r\n - wooden pins\r\n  * form \r\n   - start from a 50*50*15mm piece of wood\r\n   - use a table saw that can be inclined to cut the base form\r\n   - use hand planes to create the slope (5 faces per wooden pin, 12 wooden pin!)\r\n   - use a miter saw to cut the top at 45°\r\n   - use scrapper to clean the top face\r\n   - use sandpaper to break sharp edges\r\n   - if you can, make the bottom face slightly concave \r\n  * carving the number\r\n   - draw number layout, or pint/glue the layout\r\n   - carve number with carving chisel\r\n   - perfect carving with a dremel and very fine carving ball\r\n   - paint the number\r\n \r\n\r\n - Mollky pin\r\n  * use a lathe\r\n  * first create the main layout (flat, slope, flat, slope flat)\r\n  * control symmetry\r\n  * create the grooves \r\n  * use sandpaper (abranet) from 120 to 1000 grit to smooth the form\r\n  \r\n![Details of joinery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remi-C/ultra_molkky/master/illustrations/joinery_details/joinery_outlined.png)\r\n - box\r\n  * wooden part\r\n   - fabricate your wooden planks (from log) or buy it (9mm thick)\r\n   - assemble planks using a half-thick rabbet\r\n   - cut planks to final height (190mm), and final width, for each part of the box (6 sides, lid, bottom)\r\n   - reinforce bottom with 30mm large planks (glued, mitter joins)\r\n   - join sides with bottom using dovetail join\r\n   - create the right angle on the side of the side parts of the box using an inclined table saw\r\n   - reinforce box side in the interior top part with 30mm large planks (glued, mitter join)\r\n   - create a groove (manual tools) in those reinforcement to the lid can slide in\r\n   - glue everything\r\n   - add teak inlay to the side and top, along with brass nails (need pre-drill)\r\n  * leather part \r\n   - create paper templates to adjust the molkky handle positioning\r\n   - cut leather following templates with a paring knife\r\n   - buff sides of leather by slightly moisturising them and compressing them with hard wood/bone\r\n   - drill holes in wooden boxe\r\n   - mark holes position on leather, use stab-awl to punch the leather accordingly (45° angle)\r\n   - create slight groove in wood ans leather so the thread will be buried and protected\r\n   - use 2 needles saddle-stitching. \r\n  * hand lettering\r\n   - prepare the surface of wood to be painted with a scrapper, so the finish is perfect and the painting won't spread\r\n   - trace letters layout with a special white pencil that can be removed with water\r\n   - paint with sign lettering lacquer, wait at least 12h. Several layers may be needed.\r\n   - remove white pencil trace with water\r\n\r\n##License\r\nYou can re-use this work in a strictly non-commercial setting as long as you site the original authors and website.\r\nOther usages are forbidden (please contact us).",
